[FirstName], 

Hope all is well. I’m reaching out regarding a new opportunity to partner with Forge52 Capital Partners on a c. ~$70m direct capital raise (~$55m from co-investors) in connection with their acquisition of a premier provider of corrosion-resistant process equipment. We’ve included some of the key investments highlights below but have also attached a teaser to provide some additional information.

If this opportunity is of interest, we’ve also attached the form NDA for your review. Upon execution, we would be happy to provide VDR access, which includes a comprehensive transaction overview, financial model, and fulsome standard and business diligence materials.

Please let us know your availability over the coming days for a brief call to provide additional background on the transaction.

Best,
Brian
